## 🔍 Troubleshooting

curl http://localhost:5173

# Check browser console for errors
# Press F12 → Console tab
```

**Fix:** Restart frontend
```bash
cd dashboard
npm run dev
```

### Issue: "Service Offline" Message

**Check:**
```bash
# Is mentor service running?
curl http://localhost:8004/health
```

**Fix:** Start mentor service
```bash
cd mentor_recommendation_service
python main.py
```

### Issue: No Mentors Loading

**Check:**
1. Created a roadmap first? (Required!)
2. MongoDB running?
3. Roadmap API running? (port 8001)

**Fix:** Create roadmap first
```
1. Go to /roadmap page
2. Generate a roadmap
3. Come back to /mentors
```

### Issue: Only Mock Mentors (No Green Badges)

**This is NORMAL!** 

Reasons:
- LinkedIn rate limiting
- Network issues
- Anti-bot measures

The system provides premium mock data as fallback.

---

## 📊 Performance Notes

### Normal Behavior:
- **First load:** 30-60 seconds (scraping LinkedIn)
- **With cache:** < 5 seconds
- **Real profiles:** 40-70% success rate

### What's Happening Behind the Scenes:
```
1. Service searches Google for LinkedIn URLs (10s)
2. Service searches Bing for LinkedIn URLs (10s)
3. Service scrapes each profile (3-5s each)
4. Service generates fallback data if needed (1s)
5. Frontend displays results
```
