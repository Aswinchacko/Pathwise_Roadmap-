## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### No Mentors Shown

**Check:** Is mentor service running?
```bash
curl http://localhost:8004/health
```

**Should return:**
```json
{"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}
```

**Fix:**
```bash
cd mentor_recommendation_service
python main.py
```

---

### No Real Profile Badges

**This is OK!** LinkedIn may be blocking scraping. The system automatically falls back to premium mock data.

**Try:**
1. Different roadmap goals ("Python Developer", "Data Scientist")
2. Click "Refresh Mentors" 
3. Try again later (LinkedIn may have rate limited)

---

### Error: "Failed to load mentors"

**Check browser console (F12):**
- Look for error messages
- Check if API calls are being made

**Check mentor service terminal:**
- Look for error logs
- Verify MongoDB connection

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
# Restart mentor service
cd mentor_recommendation_service
python main.py
```

---

## 🎉 What This Proves

✅ **Backend scraping works** - Terminal shows real scraping
✅ **Frontend integration works** - Roadmap goal automatically used
✅ **Real profiles found** - Green badges appear
✅ **UI displays correctly** - Cards, badges, animations work
✅ **Fallback system works** - Always shows mentors
✅ **End-to-end flow works** - User goal → Scraping → Display
