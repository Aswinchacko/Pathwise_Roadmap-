## Technical Details

### Stack Overflow Design Elements
1. **Typography**: Clean sans-serif with proper hierarchy

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No questions showing
**Solution**: Run `node seedDiscussions.js` in auth_back folder

### Issue: Can't create questions
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged in and have valid JWT token

### Issue: Styles look wrong
**Solution**: Clear browser cache, check CSS file is loaded

### Issue: Backend errors
**Solution**: 
1. Check MongoDB is running
2. Verify .env has correct MONGODB_URI
3. Check auth_back/server.js for errors

### Issue: Vote button not working
**Solution**: Check network tab for failed API calls, verify JWT token
