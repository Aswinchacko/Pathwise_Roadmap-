## 📊 How It Works End-to-End

### User Journey

1. **User creates roadmap**: "Become a React Developer"
   ```
   → Saved to MongoDB
   → Saved to localStorage
   ```

2. **User navigates to Mentors page**
   ```
   → Frontend detects roadmap goal
   → Calls: POST http://localhost:8004/api/mentors/roadmap-based
   → Sends: {
       user_id: "abc123",
       roadmap_goal: "Become a React Developer",  
       domain: "Frontend Development",
       limit: 10
     }
   ```

3. **Backend scrapes LinkedIn** (30-90 seconds)
   ```
   → Extract keywords: ["React", "JavaScript", "Frontend Developer"]
   → Search Google: "site:linkedin.com/in React senior OR lead"
   → Find LinkedIn URLs: [url1, url2, url3...]
   → Scrape each profile: name, title, company, location
   → Generate complete mentor profiles
   → Fill remaining with premium fallbacks
   → Return: 10 mentors (7 real + 3 fallback)
   ```

4. **Frontend displays mentors**
   ```
   → 7 cards with GREEN "Real LinkedIn Profile" badge
   → 3 cards with standard styling (fallback)
   → All mentors clickable → open actual LinkedIn profiles
   → Show relevance scores
   → Display skills, experience, rates
   ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Console Errors

**Error:** `Failed to load mentors from LinkedIn scraping service`

```bash
# Is mentor service running?
curl http://localhost:8004/health

# Should return: {"status": "healthy", ...}
```

**Fix:**
```bash
cd mentor_recommendation_service
python main.py
```

---

**Error:** `Roadmap data for mentors: null`

**Cause:** No roadmap created yet

**Fix:**
1. Go to Roadmap page
2. Click "Generate Roadmap"
3. Enter goal: "Become a React Developer"
4. Generate
5. Return to Mentors page

---

**Error:** `MongoDB connection error`

**Fix:**
```bash
# Start MongoDB
mongod

# Verify it's running
mongosh
```

---

### No Real Profiles Showing

**This is NORMAL!** LinkedIn actively blocks scraping. The system automatically provides premium fallback data.

**Want more real profiles?**
- Try different roadmap topics
- Use the "Refresh Mentors" button
- Wait and try again later (LinkedIn may have rate limited)
