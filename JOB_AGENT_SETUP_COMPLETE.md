# 🎯 Real-World Job Agent - Setup Complete

## ✅ What's Been Created

### 1. **Job Agent Service** (`job_agent_service/`)
A powerful backend service that:
- ✅ Fetches **real jobs** from LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter
- ✅ Uses **Groq AI** to match jobs to user's roadmap/skills
- ✅ Provides **intelligent job scoring** (0-100 match percentage)
- ✅ **Auto-caches jobs** for 6 hours (saves API calls)
- ✅ **Multiple API sources** with smart fallback

### 2. **Updated Jobs Page** (`dashboard/src/pages/Jobs.jsx`)
Frontend now shows:
- Real-time job listings from actual job boards
- AI match scores for each job
- Skills/requirements for each position
- Direct "Apply Now" links to job postings
- Remote job indicators
- Source attribution (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Configure API Key

Copy your Groq API key from the chatbot service:

```bash
# Open chatbot_service/.env and copy your GROQ_API_KEY
# Then create job_agent_service/.env with:
```

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_key_here
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/
PORT=5007
```

### Step 2: Start the Job Agent

```bash
start_job_agent.bat
```

Service will run on: **http://localhost:5007**

### Step 3: Test It

```bash
python test_job_agent.py
```

### Step 4: Use the Frontend

1. Start your dashboard: `start_frontend.bat`
2. Navigate to the **Jobs/Opportunities** page
3. Jobs automatically load based on your roadmap!
4. Or search for specific jobs (e.g., "React Developer")

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Test:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start service
start_job_agent.bat

# Terminal 2: Run tests
python test_job_agent.py
```

### Browser Test:
1. Go to http://localhost:5007/docs
2. Try the `/api/jobs/search` endpoint
3. Use Swagger UI to test different queries

### Frontend Test:
1. Start dashboard: `start_frontend.bat`
2. Open Jobs page
3. Should see real jobs immediately
4. Try searching for different roles

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load jobs"
- ✅ Make sure `start_job_agent.bat` is running
- ✅ Check job agent is on port 5007
- ✅ Verify GROQ_API_KEY in `.env`

### "No jobs found"
- ✅ Service falls back to AI-generated jobs automatically
- ✅ Try broader search terms
- ✅ Check API key limits haven't been exceeded

### "MongoDB connection failed"
- ⚠️ Service works without MongoDB (no caching)
- ⚠️ User profile features still work with defaults
