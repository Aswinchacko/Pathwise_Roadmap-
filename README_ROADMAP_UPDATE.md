## 🚀 How to Use

### Start the Roadmap API

```bash
cd roadmap_api
python main.py
```

API will run on `http://localhost:8003`

### Test the System

```bash
python verify_roadmap_update.py
```

Shows database stats and verification.

```bash
python test_updated_roadmap_system.py
```

Tests 25 different queries (requires API to be running).

### Use in Frontend

The roadmap service will automatically use the updated algorithm:

```javascript
const roadmap = await roadmapService.generateRoadmap(
  "Full Stack Developer",
  "Full Stack Development"
);
```
