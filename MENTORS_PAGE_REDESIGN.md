## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Service Offline" Message

**Problem:** Mentor service not running

**Fix:**
```bash
cd mentor_recommendation_service
python main.py
```

Wait for: `Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8004`

### No Mentors Showing

**Checklist:**
1. ✅ Mentor service running (check http://localhost:8004/health)
2. ✅ Roadmap created first
3. ✅ MongoDB running
4. ✅ Roadmap API running (port 8001)

### Only Mock Mentors (No Green Badges)

**This is normal!** LinkedIn scraping success depends on:
- Network conditions
- Rate limiting
- LinkedIn's anti-bot measures

The system automatically provides premium mock data as fallback.

### Slow Loading

**Normal behavior:**
- Real scraping takes 30-90 seconds
- System is searching Google/Bing for LinkedIn profiles
- Then scraping each profile

**To speed up:**
- Reduce limit from 10 to 5 in code
- Use mock data only (for testing)
