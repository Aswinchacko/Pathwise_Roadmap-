# Using User's Roadmap Goal to Find Mentors

## 🎯 How It Works

The mentor service **already uses** your roadmap goal to find the most relevant mentors! Here's exactly how:

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Read User's Roadmap from MongoDB**
   ```
   User's Goal: "Become a React Developer specializing in e-commerce"
   Domain: "Frontend Development"
   ```

2. **Extract Specific Technologies from Goal**
   ```
   Keywords extracted: ['react', 'javascript', 'typescript', 'ecommerce']
   ```

3. **Build Targeted Search Query**
   ```
   Search: "Frontend Development react javascript typescript developer engineer India"
   ```

4. **Find Real Mentors on Google**
   - Searches for professionals with those exact skills
   - Filters for mid-level (not CEOs/CTOs)
   - From various sources (LinkedIn, GitHub, portfolios)

5. **Return Matched Results**
   - Mentors with React experience
   - Working on e-commerce projects
   - In the same domain
